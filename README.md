# halloweenDisplay
Raspberry Pi-enabled light and sound display for Halloween. The display uses an IR sensor (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XQRKD4) to detect someone's presence. After presence is detected, two applications trigger the playing of a random MP3 file and a flashing LED display (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZAVJJL; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTOAWZ2).
