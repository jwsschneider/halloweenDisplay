# halloweenDisplay
Raspberry Pi-enabled light and sound display for Halloween. The display uses an IR sensor (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007XQRKD4) to detect someone's presence. After presence is detected, two applications trigger the playing of a random MP3 file and a flashing LED display (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZAVJJL; https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DTOAWZ2).

Special thanks to gtoal's Instructables tutorial for the LED wiring (https://www.instructables.com/id/Easiest-RGB-LED-Strip-With-Raspberry-Pi) and Vivek Kartha for the IR sensor's wiring diagram (https://electrosome.com/pir-motion-sensor-hc-sr501-raspberry-pi/).
